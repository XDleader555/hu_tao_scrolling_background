# Hu Tao Scrolling Background
Website based background inspired by the scrolling text seen at [0:46 in the Character Demo - "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware"](https://youtu.be/qrH9vMZBwAk?t=46).
Her ghost companion was extracted from the video and edited in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to increase sharpness.
The text was rendered at 4k to avoid redistributing the ttf.
